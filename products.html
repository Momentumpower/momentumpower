                (HSFO; RFO; HFO; FFO; FO)</h2>
            <p>Furnace oil is a product of direct distillation of diesel oil fractions. Due to its excellent thermal capacity and low cost it is widely used for heating of private houses, stationary heating systems, industrial buildings and power plants. Furnace oil is residual fuel oil of different viscosity and produced from oil distillation residues. The approximate viscosity of the product is 50OC. they are often used in industries for refueling of large generators. Heavy fuel is denser and may freeze in containers without additional heating, especially is the cold season. The boiler heated with furnace oil has high efficiency and require minimal operator's participation, therefore it is in demand for heating of sub-urban real estate using autonomous systems. It does not have to comply with strict standards for the cetane and iodine numbers, cloud points, and the Sulphur content often exceeds 1%. It means that such fuel cheaper and easier than diesel oil and as a result, it is cheaper. To improve its technical parameters, heating (furnace) oil is lightened. Lightening means eliminating the impurities (using Sulphurous) using special substances.

            <h2 class="customclr">High Speed Diesel (HSD)</h2>
            <p>Diesel oil is used for the operation of piston diesel internal combustion engine. In gasoline engines, ignition occurs from a spark, whereas in diesel engines fuel ignites when compressed under high pressure. The exhaust gas temperature of diesel engine is lower than that of a gasoline engine. Due to which the loss of heat and power is reduced, which makes the diesel more economical. Previously, the production and sale of diesel oil was associated mainly with large and heavy equipment, but today more and more cars are provided with diesel engines. Environmental friendliness and operating qualities of diesel oil is constantly increasing alongside expanding the possibilities of application. In addition to automotive equipment, diesel oil is used for generators of power plants, heating boilers, water and railway transport. The main indicator of diesel oil quality is cetane number (CN). It is responsible for the time interval between ingress of oil into the cylinder and ignition. The higher the CN, the shorter this time and the higher the cost of diesel oil. Hight CN of diesel oil determines:

                Complete combustion of diesel oil without engine overheating
                Increase the traction parameters
                Increase the service life of engine parts
                Increase the power and economy of diesel engine
                Each diesel engine is engineered for a specific CN, at which it will operate optimally. Therefore, a high figure is not always the best. Preferred values of the CN lie in the range from 50 - 60</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Coal is combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams. Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen, Sulphur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years. As a fossil fuel burnt for heat, coal supplies about a quarter of the world's primary energy and 2/5th of its electricity. Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal. Different varieties of coal arise because of differences in the kinds of plants material (coal type), degree of coalification (coal rank), and range of impurities (coal grade). Coal is an abundant natural resource that can be used as a source of energy, as a chemical source from which numerous synthetic compounds can be derived and in the production of coke for metallurgical processes. Coal is a major source of energy in the production of electrical power using steam generation.</p>

Bitumen has excellent water-proofing properties and is widely used for making roofing products along with a range of other household and industrial applications, from emulsion paints to sound-proofing. Bitumen has been proven to be effective on both high-speed railway tracks and heavy-load railway tracks. It is also used for surfacing airfield runways and air strips and taxi ways. For the marine construction industry bitumen is used of hydraulic applications such as canal lining, underwater tunnels, river bank protection, dam construction and sea defence. There are also numerous industrial applications like roofing felt material, printing inks, packaging paper, linoleum, electrical cable/junction box insulation, mastic for roofing of terraces, and duplex paper manufacture. The penetration test determines the hardness of bitumen by measuring the depth(in tenths of mm) to which a standard, and loaded needle will vertically penetrate in 5 seconds, a sample of bitumen maintained at a temperature of 250c. hence the softer the bitumen, the greater will be its number of penetration units. We offer the following grades of penetration bitumen including Bitumen 80/100, Bitumen 85/100, Bitumen 35/50, Bitumen 40/50, Bitumen 50/70, Bitumen 60/70 and Bitumen 160/220.</p>
